===================

A collection of utilities.

Enumerable
----------

A trivial lightweight Linq style enumerator library with a fluent API.

My use case was a system that provided collections of data to process that were too large to be copied. The Enumerable class is a wrapper around the Iterable interface providing the typical enumeration operations.

The intention of the library is to be trivial, obvious, simple, and lightweight.
